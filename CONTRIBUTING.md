- When translating the label for a bilingual country make two versions for each language ex.<!--Canadian version-English> and <!--Canadian version-French-->
- Do not use an automatic translator ex.Google Translate for translating the phrase. You must speak fluently the language in which you translate the text.
- You must translate the phrase without making any changes ex.**DO NOT** capitalise letters, add continets, change the link or spaces between words etc.

__Adding the label on your site:__
- You have the right to use the phrase on your product or site and make small changes ex."Made in Europe"
